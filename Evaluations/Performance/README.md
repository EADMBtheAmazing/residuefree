The python scripts should run in their entirity if run in order; require matplotlib and pandas packages.
Each directory contains the test data, scripts used to generate the data, and test-specific information.

Performance tests were conducted on a Toshiba Satellite laptop running an Intel Core i3-5015U CPU @ 2.10 GHz (quad core), with 6GB of RAM and a 500 GB HDD (as we describe it in the paper, a potato). When using ResidueFree in VMs allocated even modest resources but running on higher-end hardware (i.e. i7 CPU and a Solid State Drive), we observed substantially improved performance.
